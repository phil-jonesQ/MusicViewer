[Refrain]
            G                                     D
It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming, football's coming home
            G                                     D
It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming, football's coming home
            G          D/F#   Em          A      D          A/C#   Bm
It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming, football's coming home
     D/A    G          D/F#   Em          A      D          A/C#   Bm     D/A
It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming, football's coming home

[Verse 1]

Em            A                 D7
    Everyone seems to know the score
        B7           Em                A                   D7
They've seen it all before, they just know,     They're so sure,
     B7               Em                  A
That England's gonna throw it away, Gonna blow it away,
      D7                           B
But I know they can play,     'Cos I remember,

[Chorus]

G           D/F#   Em         A
Three Lions on  a  shirt,
D       A/C#       Bm        D/A
Jules Rimmet still gleaming,
G      D/F#        Em       A
Thirty years of hurt,
D      A/C#       Bm        D/A
Never stopped me dreaming

[Verse 2]

Em           A               D7
    So many jokes, so many sneers,
    B7               Em                A                       D7
But all those "Oh so nears", wear you down   through the years,
    B7               Em                           A
But I still see that tackle by Moore,   And when Lineker scored,
      D7                          B
Bobby belting the ball,      and Nobby dancing,

[Chorus]

G          D/F#    Em         A
Three Lions on  a  shirt,
D       A/C#       Bm        D/A
Jules Rimmet still gleaming,
G      D/F#        Em         A
Thirty years of hurt,
D     A/C#       Bm        D/A
Never stopped me dreaming

[Break]

Em                      C                     B
       I know that was then, but it could be again...

[Refrain]

G                                 D
   It's coming home, it's coming, football's coming home
            G                                     D
It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming, football's coming home
            G          D/F#   Em         A       D          A/C#   Bm
It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming, football's coming home
     D/A    G          D/F#   Em         A       D          A/C#   Bm         D/A
It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming, football's coming home, it's coming home...

G          D/F#    Em         A
Three Lions on  a  shirt,
D       A/C#       Bm        D/A
Jules Rimmet still gleaming,
G      D/F#        Em         A
Thirty years of hurt,
D     A/C#       Bm        D/A
Never stopped me dreaming
