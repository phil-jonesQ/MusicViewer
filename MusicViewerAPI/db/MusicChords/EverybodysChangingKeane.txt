[Intro]

C    Cmaj7   C  Cmaj7
C    Cmaj7   C  Cmaj7
C    Cmaj7   Dm  Cmaj7
C    Cmaj7   C  Cmaj7


[Verse]

C                        F
You say you wander your own land
     Dm
But when I think about it
   G                    C   Cmaj7   C   Cmaj7
I don't see how you can

        C
You're aching, you're breaking
    F
And I can see the pain in your eyes
      Dm
Says everybody's changing
    G               C   Cmaj7    C   Cmaj7
And I don't know why


[Chorus]

F           G
So little time
C                       F
Try to understand that I'm
Dm                             G
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
   Em7                     A
I try to stay awake and remember my name
      Dm                        G                C   Cmaj7  C  Cmaj7
But everybody's changing and I don't feel the same

Etc....


[Verse]

        C
You're gone from here
    F
Soon you will disappear
Fading into beautiful light
      Dm
'cos everybody's changing
    G               C   Cmaj7    C   Cmaj7
And I don't feel right


[Chorus]

F           G
So little time
C                       F
Try to understand that I'm
Dm                             G
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
   Em7                     A
I try to stay awake and remember my name
      Dm                        G                C   Cmaj7  C  Cmaj7
But everybody's changing and I don't feel the same

F           G
So little time
C                       F
Try to understand that I'm
Dm                             G
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
   Em7                     A
I try to stay awake and remember my name
      Dm                        G                C   Cmaj7  C  Cmaj7
But everybody's changing and I don't feel the same
