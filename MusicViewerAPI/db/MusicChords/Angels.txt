E
I sit and wait 
                     A            C#m  B
does an angel contemplate my fate 
            E
and do they know
 
the places where we go 
                     A   C#m B
when weｴre grey and old
               F#m
ｴcos Iｴve been told 
           A               C#m7          A
that salvation lets their wings unfold 
            D
so when I知 lying in my bed 
         A/C#   
thoughts running through my head
      E                       D
and I feel that love is dead
           A/C#        E
I知 loving angels instead

[Chorus]
                 B                     C#m
and through it all she offers me protection 
                    A
a lot of love and affection 
                     E
whether I知 right or wrong
                   B 
and down the waterfall
                 C#m 
wherever it may take me 
                       A
I know that life wont break me
                E/G#            F#m      D
when I come to call she wont forsake me 
           A/C#            E
I知 loving angels instead 
[Verse]

E         
when I知 feeling weak 
                          A             C#m B
and my pain walks down a one way street
         E 
I look above 
                         A                C#m  B
and I know ill always be blessed with love
     D     
and as the feeling grows 
              A/C#
she breathes flesh to my bones
     E                 D
and when love is dead 
           A/C#       E
I知 loving angels instead 
[Chorus]
               B                   C#m
and through it all she offers me protection 
                    A
a lot of love and affection 
                     E
whether I知 right or wrong
                   B 
and down the waterfall
                 C#m 
wherever it may take me 
                       A
I know that life wont break me
                E/G#            F#m       D
when I come to call she wont forsake me 
           A/C#       E
I知 loving angels instead
