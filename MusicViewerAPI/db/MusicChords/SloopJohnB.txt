Beach Boys-Sloop John B
C
We come on the sloop john b

My grandfather and me
                           G
Around nassau town we did roam
              C
Drinking all night
             F
Got into a fight
C                     
Well I feel so broke up
G               C
I want to go home
[Chorus]
C
So hoist up the john b’s sail

See how the mainsail sets
                                 
Call for the captain ashore
            G              C
Let me go home, let me go home
            F
I wanna go home

C                               
Well I feel so broke up
G           C
I wanna go home
[Verse 2]
C
The first mate he got drunk
        
And broke in the cap’n’s trunk
                                        G
The constable had to come and take him away
               C      
Sheriff john stone
                         F
Why don’t you leave me alone
C                          G         C
Well I feel so broke up I wanna go home
[Chorus]

C
So hoist up the john b’s sail

See how the mainsail sets
                                 
Call for the captain ashore
            G              C
Let me go home, let me go home
            F
I wanna go home
C                               
Well I feel so broke up

G           C
I wanna go home
