<u>Dm</u>                     <u>C</u> 
Hello darkness, my old friend,
                           <u>Dm</u>
I've come to talk with you again,
          <u>F</u>             <u>Bb</u>   <u>F</u>  
Because a vision softly creeping,
                           <u>Bb</u>   <u>F</u> 
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
        <u>Bb</u>                            <u>F</u>
And the vision that was planted in my brain
      <u>Dm</u>
Still remains
<u>F</u>          <u>C</u>         <u>Dm</u>
Within the sounds of silence.
 
<u>Dm</u>                          <u>C</u> 
In restless dreams I walked alone
                                <u>Dm</u>
Through narrow streets of cobblestone,
                <u>F</u>    <u>Bb</u>     <u>F</u> 
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
                          <u>Bb</u>       <u>F</u>
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        <u>Bb</u>                                       <u>F</u> 
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
               <u>Dm</u>
That split the night
<u>F</u>               <u>C</u>         <u>Dm</u> 
And touched the sounds of silence.
 
<u>Dm</u>                       <u>C</u>
And in the naked light I saw
                           <u>Dm</u> 
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
               <u>F</u>       <u>Bb</u>   <u>F</u> 
People talking without speaking,
                       <u>Bb</u>   <u>F</u>  
People hearing without listening,
               <u>Bb</u>                      <u>F</u> 
People writing songs that voices never shared
           <u>Dm</u> 
And no one dared
<u>F</u>           <u>C</u>         <u>Dm</u> 
Disturb the sounds of silence.
 
<u>Dm</u>                          <u>C</u>
"Fools" said I, "You do not know
                      <u>Dm</u> 
Silence like a cancer grows.
                   <u>F</u>       <u>Bb</u>    <u>F</u> 
Hear my words that I might teach you,
                          <u>Bb</u>    <u>F</u>
Take my arms that I might reach you."
       <u>Bb</u>                          <u>F</u>
But my words like silent raindrops fell ...
<u>Dm</u>     <u>F</u>  
And echoed
       <u>C</u>        <u>Dm</u> 
In the wells of silence
                         <u>C</u>
And the people bowed and prayed
                     <u>Dm</u>
To the neon god they made.
             <u>F</u>               <u>Bb</u>  <u>F</u> 
And the sign flashed out its warning,
                         <u>Bb</u>  <u>F</u>    
In the words that it was forming.
                        <u>Bb</u>                                              <u>F</u>
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
             <u>Dm</u>
And tenement halls." 
    <u>F</u>                <u>C</u>         <u>Dm</u>
And whispered in the sounds of silence.
