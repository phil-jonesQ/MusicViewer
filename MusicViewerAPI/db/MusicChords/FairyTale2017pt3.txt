       G          Bm A
The boys of the NYPD choir
       D                Bm
Still singing `Galway Bay`
        D          G
And the bells are ringing
A                 D
Out for Christmas Day

Nah Nah nah

A            D
I could have been someone
         G
Well, So could anyone
            D
You took my dreams
                     A
From me when I first found you
            D
I kept them with me babe
           G
I put them with my own
              D
Can't make it all alone
              G      A      D
I've built my dreams around you
