It's  C  nine o' -   G/B    clock on a   F/A    Saturday  C/G   
F    The regular   C/E    crowd shuffles  D7   in  G 
There's an  C   old man G/B     sitting  F/A    next to me  C/G   
Making  F   love to his  G7sus4        tonic and  C   gin


C - G/B - F/A - C/G - F - G7sus4 - C -     F/C


He says, &qCuot;    Son, can G/Byou      play F/Ame a       memC/Gory?
I'm   F  not really  C/E     sure how it  D7   goes, G 
But it's  C   sad and it's  G/B    sweet and I  F/A    knew it com - C/G      plete
When  F   I wore a  G7sus4        younger man's  C   clothes"

F   Sing us a  C/E     song to - D7    nightG
'Cause we're  C   all in the  G/B     mood for a  F/A     melody  C/G

Now  C   John at the  G/B     bar is a  F/A     friend of mine   C/G   
He  F   gets me my  C/E     drinks for D7    free  G 
And he's  C   quick with a  G/B    joke or a  F/A    light up your C/G     smoke,
But there's  F  some place that's  G7sus4        he'd rather  C   be       F/C   


He says, &quCot;    Bill, I bG/Be -       lieve thisF/A is      killing mC/Ge,"
As the  F  smile ran a - C/E     way from his  D7    face  G 
"Well, CI'm     sure thaG/Bt I       could bF/Ae a      movie C/Gstar
If  F   I could get  G7sus4        out of this  C   place."

Now  C  Paul is a  G/B     real estate  F/A     novelist  C/G   
Who  F   never had  C/E     time for a  D7   wife G 
And he's  C   talking to  G/B     Davy who's  F/A     still in the  C/G     Navy
And  F  probably  G7sus4        will be for  C   life

And the  C   Waitress is  G/B     practicing  F/A     politics  C/G   
As the  F   businessmen  C/E     slowly get  D7    stoned  G 
Yes, they're  C   sharing a  G/B     drink they call  F/A     loneliness,  C/G

It's a  C   pretty good  G/B     crowd for a F/A     Saturday C/G   
And the  F   manager  C/E     gives me a  D7   smile  G 
'Cause he C   knows that it's  G/B    me they've been  F/A    coming to C/G     see

And the  F   microphone  C/E     smells like a  D7    beer  G 
And they  C   sit at the  G/B     bar and put  F/A     bread in my C/G     jar
