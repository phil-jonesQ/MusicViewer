[Verse 1]
Am
Once there was a way
              Dm
To get back homeward
G
Once there was a way
             C
To get back home

[Chorus]
Em              Am            Dm
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
G                C
I will sing a lullaby
C        F                 C
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
C       F                  C
Smiles awake you when you rise
Em              Am            Dm
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
G                  C
And I will sing a lullaby
G                  C
And I will sing a lullaby

[Verse 2]
Am

C        F                 C
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
C       F                  C
Smiles awake you when you rise
Em              Am            Dm

And I will sing a lullaby
