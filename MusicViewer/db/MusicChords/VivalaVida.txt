C-D-G-Em 


[Verse]

              C           D
I used to rule the world
                    G                              Em
Seas would rise when I gave the word
                                  C            D
Now in the morning I sleep alone
                 G                        Em
Sweep the streets I used to own


[Instrumental]

C-D-G-Em

[Verse]

                C           D
I used to roll the dice
               G                            Em
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
                      C                  D
Listen as the crowd would sing
               G                           Em
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

                      C             D
One minute I held the key
                 G                              Em
Next the walls were closed on me
                                         C          D
And I discovered that my castles stand
           G                        Em
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand


[Chorus]

   C                       D    
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
G                       Em
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
C                          D
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
     G                         Em
My missionaries in a foreign field
C                             D            
For some reason I can't explain
G                                   Em
Once you go there was never
                C           D
Never an honest word
                     G                       Em
And that was when I ruled the world


[Instrumental]

[Verse]

                                   C      D
It was the wicked and wild wind
                        G                      Em
Blew down the doors to let me in
                                             C            D
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
             G                                  Em
People couldn't believe what I'd become
                 C       D
Revolutionaries wait
            G                        Em
For my head on a silver plate
                               C        D 
Just a puppet on a lonely string
                         G                      Em
Oh who would ever want to be king?


[Chorus]

  C                        D        
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
G                     Em
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
C                           D
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
G                               Em
My missionaries in a foreign field
C                             D
For some reason I can't explain
G                                    Em
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
C                   D
Never an honest word
                     G                        Em
But that was when I ruled the world

  C                        D
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
G                       Em
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
C                             D 
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
        G                         Em
My missionaries in a foreign field
C                             D     
For some reason I can't explain
  G                                  Em
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
               C           D  
Never an honest word
                     G                       Em
But that was when I ruled the world

[Chorus]

  C              D
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
G             Em
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
C                D
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
   G                 Em
My missionaries in a foreign field 
C                 D
For some reason I can't explain 
  G                     Em              
I know Saint Peter will call my name ,
   C            D 
never an honest word
              G                               Em 
But that was when I ruled the world
