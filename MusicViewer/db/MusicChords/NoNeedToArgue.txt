C             F         G         C
   There’s no need to argue anymore
C             F              G             C
   I gave all I could but it left me so sore
          F                    G
And the thing that makes me mad
        C                Am
Is the one thing that I had
  F       G                C 
I knew, I knew I'd loose you
              Am            F
You'll always be special to me
           G      C
Special to me, to me
C            F              G                 C
    And I remember all the things we once shared
C             F                 G                 C
    Watching TV movies on the living room armchair
C            F                   G
    But they say it'll work out fine
       C              Am
Was it all a waste of time
        F       G              C     
Cause I knew, I knew I'd loose you
              Am            F
You'll always be special to me
           G      C       C
Special to me, to me
Am             |Am       G     |
   Will I forget in time
Am               |Am       G     |
   You said I was on your mind
Am        |Am        G     |
There's no need to argue
F              G       C    Am
   No need to argue anymore
           F         G      C
There's no need to argue anymore
