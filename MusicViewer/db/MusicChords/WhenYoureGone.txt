(Verse)
C           Am 
Hold on to love
             Em 
That is what I do
               G 
Now that I've found you
C          Am 
And from above
            Em 
Everything's stinking
            G 
They're not around you
    C 
And in the night
          Am 
I could be helpless
           Em                     G 
I could be lonely, sleeping without you
    C                       Am 
And in the day, everything's complex
                Em                  G 
There's nothing simple when I'm not around you

(Chorus)
      C                    Am 
But I miss you when you're gone
        Em        F 
That is what I do

Hey baby
C                  Am 
It's hard to carry on
             Em     F 
That is what I knew

Hey baby...

(guitar solo part, which I haven't figured out yet, if someone could please post it :)

(Verse)
C          Am 
Hold on to my hands
          Em 
I feel I'm sinking
           G 
Sinking without you
C         Am 
And to my mind
            Em 
Everything's stinking
           G 
Stinking without you
    C                      Am 
And in the night I could be helpless
          Em                  G 
I could be lonely, sleeping without you
     C                      Am 
And in the day, everything's complex
               Em 
There's nothing simple
               G 
When I'm not around you

(Chorus)
       C                    Am 
And I miss you when you're gone
             Em   F 
That is what I do

Hey baby
C                  Am 
And it's hard to carry on
             Em   F 
That is what I do
