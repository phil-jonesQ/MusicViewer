A                                          G
So no one told you life was gonna be this way
A                                             C#m
Your jobs a joke you're broke, your love lifes D.O.A
G               Bm                    A 
Its like your always stuck in second gear 
           G               D                E       
When it hasn't been your day your week or month or even your year
       A       D        E
(But)I'll be there for you(when the rain starts to pour)
A          D       E

A          D       E                            G  A 
I'll be there for you('cause your there for me too)
A                                          G
you're still in bed at ten & work began at 8
A                                                   C#m
you've burnt your breakfast so far things are going great 
G              Bm                 A
your mother warned you there'd be days like these 
           G              D                  E
But she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees
       A       D        E
(But)I'll be there for you(when the rain starts to pour)
A          D       E
I'll be there for you(like i've been there before)
A          D       E                            G  A 
I'll be there for you('cause your there for me too)
