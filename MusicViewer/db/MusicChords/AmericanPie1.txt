 G     D        Em      
A long, long time ago__   
Am             C              Em                     D 
I can still remember how that music used to make me smile.__
.   G         D     Em             Am                 C  
And I knew if I had my chance that I could make those people dance 
.   Em               C           D 
and maybe they'd by happy for a while.
Em            Am             Em              Am            
But February made me shiver with every paper I'd deliver.  
.C       G       Am           C                 D         
Bad news on the doorstep.  I couldn't take one more step  
.  G       D        Em             Am7            D 
I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride,
G           D         Em              C       D7       G   C  G 
Something touched me deep inside the day_ the music  died._____

Chorus:
.       G    C         G       D           G             C            
.   So bye-bye, Miss American Pie.Drove my Chevy to the levee but the 
.    G         D         G        C                  G          D     
.   levee was dry, them good ole boys were drinkin' whiskey and Rye, singing
.   Em                        A7      Em                         D7 
.   this'll be the day that I die,    This'll be the day that I die.__
verse:
G                 Am                  C                 Am      
Did you write the book of love and do you have faith in God above?__ 
.      Em               D           G      D       Em                 
If the Bible tells you so__  Now do you believe in rock and roll?  
.   Am              C               Em                       A7           D7 
Can music save your mortal soul? and can you teach me how to dance_ real slow?
.       Em                 Am                     Em              Am         
Well I know that you're in love with him 'cause I saw you dancing in the gym,
_    C        G          A7            C                    D7     
You both kicked off your shoes,  Man I dig those rhythm and blues!
.        G      D        Em                   Am                   C 
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck, with a pink carnation and a pick-up truck.
.   G      D     Em               C        D7     G  C  G 
But I knew I was out of luck the day, the music died.___ 
G           D7 
I started singing....     (chorus)
