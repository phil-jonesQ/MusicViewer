NC       C
When you walk through a storm,
          G
Hold your head, up high.
    F         C             G   Bb
And don't be afraid, of the dark.
             Dm         Bb         F      Dm
Cause at the end of the storm is a golden sky,
        Bb    Am     Gm   F      E    C
And the sweet silver song of the lark.


[Chorus]

     F               E7         Am              F
Walk on, through the wind, walk on, through the rain,
            C         Em         F     G
though your dreams be tossed and blown.


[Verse]

     C        C7       F             D
Walk on, walk on, with hope, in your heart,
           C   C7  F    G  F    C
and you'll ne..ver walk a..lon..e.
G7     C     F    G  F    C
You'll never walk a..lon..e.


[Chorus]

     F               E7         Am              F
Walk on, through the wind, walk on, through the rain,
            C         Em         F     G
though your dreams be tossed and blown.
     F               E7         Am              F
Walk on, through the wind, walk on, through the rain,
            C         Em         F     G
though your dreams be tossed and blown.


[Outro]

     C        C7       F            D
Walk on, walk on, with hope in your hearts..
    G7     C     F      C
and you'll never walk, alone.
