             G
When you were here before
                         B 
Couldn't look you in the eyes
                 C
You look like an angel
                   Cm
Your skin makes me cry 
                 G
You float like a feather
              B
In a beautiful weather
             C
I wish I was special
                  Cm
You're so xxxxing special
               G
     But I'm a creep
           B
     I'm a wierdo
                              C
     What the hell am I doin' here
                    Cm
     I don't belong here
Verse - same as first -:

When I'm not around
You're so xxxxin' special
I wish I was special....
Chorus:
