[Verse]

G
Do you remember a guy that's been
Em7
In such an early song
C
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control
D
Oh no, don't say it's true
F
They got a message from the Action Man
C          Em                F  
I'm happy, hope you're happy too
                              G
I've loved all I've needed to love
          E/G#
Sordid details following
A
The shrieking of nothing is killing 
    E
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
G                                     D
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
F                                          C     Em
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet it's glowing___


[Chorus]

F               G
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
C              Am
We know Major Toms a junkie
F                      G
Strung out in heaven's high
           Am       G    Dm
Hitting an all-time low


[Instrumental]

Am  | G   | Dm   | Am   |
Am  | G   | Dm   | Am   |
Am  | G   | Dm   | Am   |
Am  | G   | Dm   | Am   |


[Verse]

G
Time and again I tell myself
Em7
I'll stay clean tonight
C                                         D
But the little green wheels are following me___
D
Oh no, not again
F
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
C           Em                F
I'm happy, hope you're happy too
                    G                   E/G#
One flash of light  but no smoking pistol
A
I never done good things
E
I never done bad things
G                                D
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-oh-oh 
F
Want an axe to break the ice
C                     Em
Wanna come down right now


[Chorus]

F               G
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
C              Am
We know Major Toms a junkie
F                      G
Strung out in heaven's high
           Am       G    Dm
Hitting an all-time low


[Bridge]

Dm             Am
My mother said to get things done
      G                    Dm
You'd better not mess  with Major Tom
Am                G
My mother said to get things done
      Dm                    Am
You'd better not mess  with Major Tom


[Outro]

Am   G    Dm   Am
