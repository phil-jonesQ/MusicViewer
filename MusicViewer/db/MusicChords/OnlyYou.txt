[Intro]
G, C, D x2
[Verse]

G              D      Em
Looking from a window above
            D        C
It's like a story of love
        G    D
Can you hear me
G              D     Em
Came back only yesterday
           D       C
I'm moving farther away
         G    D
Want you near me
[Chorus]
C                    D
All I needed was the love you gave
G                 Em
All I needed for another day
    C          Dsus4/D
And all I ever knew
G        C, D
Only you
G, C, D
[Verse]
G                D            Em
Sometimes when I think of her name
          D      C
When it's only a game
      G    D
And I need you
G                D              Em
Listening to the words that you say
             D         C
It's getting harder to stay
       G   D
When I see you
[Chorus]
G, C, D x2
[Chorus]
[Verse]

G             D           Em
This is gonna take a long time
      D             C
And I wonder what's mine
      G       D
Can't take no more
G                D    Em
Wonder if you'll understand
              D             C
It's just the touch of your hand
         G      D
Behind a closed door
[Chorus]
G, C, D
G, C, D break, G
        Only   you
