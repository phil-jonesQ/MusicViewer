   G                 Am               C           Am      
And there we were all in one place,  A generation lost in space.
.   Em                       D                   G      D       Em 
With no time left, to start again. So come on, Jack be nimble, jack be quick,
Am                  C                     Em          A7            D7 
Jack flash sat on a candlestick.   'Cause fire is the devil's only friend.
.   Em               Am               Em                     Am  
And as I watched him on the stage  my hands were clenched in fists of rage.
.  C     G       A7              C                 D7     
no angel born in hell__   could break that satan's spell
.  G        D             Em                      Am            C 
And as the flames climbed high into the night to light the sacrificial rite
G      D              Em                 C        D7     G   C  G 
I_ saw Satan laughing with delight,  the day the music died.    
G          D7 
we were singin'     (chorus)
.
.  G     D       Em                
I met a girl who sang the blues so 
.  Am                  C            Em                                D 
I asked her for some happy news but she just smiled__    and turned away.
. G     D          Em                      Am              C 
I went down to the sacred store.  Where I heard the music years before.__
.       Em                 C              D 
But the man there said the music wouldn't play.__     And
Em                  Am                    Em                   Am    
in the streets the children screamed, the lovers cried and the poets dreamed.
.    C     G        Am              C                          D 
But not a word was spoken.__  The church__ bells_ all_ were_ broken.
.         G       D   Em               Am7                 D  
And the three men I admire most:  the father, Son and the Holy Ghost__
.     G          D         Em                 C       D7     G   C  G 
They caught the last train for the coast the day, the music died.
G             D7                              C             D7         G C G 
And they were singing:(chorus twice, ending: this'll be the day that I die)
.
