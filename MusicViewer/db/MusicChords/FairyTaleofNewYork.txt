It was Christmas  
D 
Eve babe, in the

drunk 
 
tank
 
An old man  
D 
said to me, won’t

A 
another 
 
one
 
And then he  
D 
sang a song
 
The Rare Old  
G 
Mountain Dew and I turned my  
D 
face 
 
away
 
And  
G 
dreamed 
 
 
A 
about 
 
 
D 
you

They’ve got
D 
cars,
 
Big as  
A 
bars
 
They’ve got  
Bm 
rivers of  
G 
gold
 
But the  
D 
wind goes right through you
 
It’s no place for the  
A 
old
 
When you  
D 
first took my  
Bm 
hand
 
On a  
D 
cold Christmas  
G 
Eve
 
You  
D 
promised 
 
me
 
Broadway was  
A 
waiting for  
D 
me
 
You were  
D 
handsome – You were pretty
 
Queen of New York  
A 
City
 
When the  
D 
band finished  
G 
playing
 
They  
A 
howled out for  
D 
more, Sinatra was swinging
 
All the drunks they were  
A 
singing
 
We  
D 
kissed on the  
G 
corner
 
And  
A 
danced through the  
D 
night
 
The  
G 
boys of the NY  
Bm 
PD 
 
 
A 
choir
 
Were  
D 
singing Galway  
Bm 
Bay
 
And the  
D 
bells were  
G 
ringing
 
A 
Out for Christmas  
D 
day

D 
You’re a bum – You’re a punk
 
You’re an old slut on  
A 
junk
 
Lying  
D 
there almost  
G 
dead on a  
A 
drip
 
In that  
D 
bed
You scum bag – You maggot

 
You cheap lousy  
A 
faggot
 
Happy  
D 
Christmas your  
G 
arse
 
I pray  
A 
God

A 
I could have  
D 
been 
 
someone

anyone
 
You took my  
D

From me when I first  
A

D 
with me babe
 
I put them  
G 
with my own
