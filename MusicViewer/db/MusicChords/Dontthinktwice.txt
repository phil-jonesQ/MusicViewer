           C                   G                      Am (2)
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
F (2)                                C        G   
    Iff'n you don't know by now
         C                     G                    Am (2)
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
D7/F# (2)                       G    G7
         It'll never do somehow
               C (2)                        C7 (2)
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
F (2)                             D7/F# (2)
Look out your window and I'll be gone
C                   G              Am      F
   You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
C                      G               C (2)
    Don't think twice, it's all right 
          C                   G                     Am (2)
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
         F (2)             C        G   
That light I never knowed
         C                     G                    Am (2)
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
D7/F# (2)                                G    G7
       I'm on the dark side of the road
           C (2)                                         C7 (2)
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
      F (2)                                   D7/F# (2)
To try and make me change my mind and stay
C              G                 Am            F
We never did too much talkin' anyway
C                           G                C (2)
    But don't think twice, it's all right
          C                   G                  Am (2)
So it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
F (2)                                C        G   
      Like you never did before
          C                   G                  Am (2)
An' it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
D7/F# (2)                            G    G7
           I can't hear you any more
           C (2)                          C7 (2)
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin' down the road
   F (2)                            D7/F# (2)
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
    C                 G                 Am             F
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
C                           G                 C (2)
     But don't think twice, it's all right
     C G              Am (2)
So long, honey babe 
                  F (2)             C    G   
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
     C            G              Am (2)
Goodbye is too good a word, gal
D7/F# (2)                                 G    G7
           So I'll just say fare thee well
C (2)                          C7 (2)
      I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
F (2)                                         D7/F# (2)
    You could have done better but I don't mind
C                          G          Am             F
    You just kinda wasted my precious time
C                       G               C (2)
But don't think twice, it's all right
