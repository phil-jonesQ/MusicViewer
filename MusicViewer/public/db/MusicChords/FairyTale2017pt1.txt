They've got cars
       A
Big as bars
            Bm        G
They've got rivers of gold

But the wind goes right through you
                      A
It's no place for the old
         D             Bm
When you first took my hand
     D              G
On a cold Christmas Eve
    D
You promised me
             A           D
Broadway was waiting for me
