  C    Em    Am             Dm        C       G  G7             
Wise   men   say    only    fools     rush    i..n                     
        F      G       Am      Dm            C       G7     C  G7

[Chorus]

Em                 B7      Em                   B7 
Like   a   river   flows   surely   to    the   sea
Em                      B7
Darling     so    it    goes
Em          A7                      Dm7   G7
Some    things   are   meant   to   b e e e

[Verse 3]

 C     Em   Am                  Dm      C      G   G7

      F   G        Am     Dm           C      G7     C
For   I   can’t    help   falling in   love   with   you

Em                 B7      Em                   B7 
Like   a   river   flows   surely   to    the   sea
Em                      B7
Darling     so    it    goes 
Em          A7                      Dm7  G7
Some    things   are   meant   to   b e e e
