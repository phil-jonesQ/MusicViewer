F      F/E                     F/Eb
It's a god-awful small affair
       D7                       Gm
To the girl with the mousy hair
       Gm/F
But her mummy is yelling "No"
C                                F
And her daddy has told her to go
        F/E                        F/Eb
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
        D7                             Gm
Now she walks through her sunken dream
       Gm/F                         C
To the seat with the clearest view
                                      Ab/Eb
And she's hooked to the silver screen

        C/E                      Fm
But the film is a saddening bore
          Ab/Gb                      Db
For she's lived it ten times or more
          F/A                        Bbm
She could spit in the eyes of fools
        Db/B
As they ask her to focus on
[Chorus]
Bb      Eb
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Gm      F#aug                        F  Fm
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
                   Cm     Ebm
It's the freakiest show
                    Bb
Take a look at the Lawman
Eb
Beating up the wrong guy
Gm      F#aug                           F   Fm
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
                           Cm    Ebm
He's in the best selling show
                  Gm  Gm/F#  Gm/F  Gm/E
Is there life on Mars?


[Verse]

F       F/E                    F/Eb
It's on Amerikas tortured brow
            D7                       Gm
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
         Gm/F                         C
Now the workers have struck for fame
                              F
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
        F/E                          F/Eb
See the mice in their million hordes
     D7                          Gm
From Ibeza to the Norfolk Broads
         Gm/F                   C
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
                                 Ab/Eb
To my mother, my dog, and clowns


[Pre-Chorus]

        C/E                       Fm
But the film is a saddening bore
         Ab/Gb                      Db
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
     F/A                    Bbm
It's about to be writ again
     Db/B
As I ask you to focus on
