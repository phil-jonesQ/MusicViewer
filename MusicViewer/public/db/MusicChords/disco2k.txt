can't work that out right.  Sus4 will do!) like

              F 
Well we were born within an hour of each other

Our mothers said we could be sister and brother
                Bb 
Your name is Deborah. Deborah - it never suited you

              F 
Oh and they said that when we grew up

We4d get married and never split up
          Bb 
We never did it, although I often I thought of it

                      Cm   [Csus2]
Oh Deborah, do you recall?
                      Cm                          Cm 
Your house was very small with wood-chips on the wall
                       Cm                           F 
When I came around to call you didn4t notice me at all

             Bb 
And I said "Let4s all meet up in the year 2000
 Dm                                         Gm 
Won4t it be strange when we4re all fully grown?
                             Cm               Fsus4  F 
Be there two o4clock by the fountain down the ro-----ad"

Bb 
I never knew that you4d get married
Dm                                 Gm 
I would be living down here on my own
                         Cm            F 
On that damp and loney Thursday years ago

               F 
You were the first girl in school to get breasts

Martyn said that you were the best
              Bb 
The boys all loved you but I was a mess

I had to watch them try to get you undressed

          F 
We were friends that was as far as it went

I used to walk you home sometimes but it meant
                      Bb 
Oh, it meant nothing to you - cos you were oh so popular
                    Cm 
Oh Deborah, do you recall?

Your house was very small with wood-chips on the wall
                                                    F
