Now for ten years, we've been on our own and moss grows fat on a rolling stone,
Em                            D                   G     D            Em  
But that's not how it used to be.Cause when the jester sang for the King & 
Queen
.    Am                C                    Em                   A7      D7 
in a coat he borrowed from James Dean and a voice that came from you and me__
.       Em                 Am                  Em               Am  
Oh and while the king was looking down    the jester stole his thorny crown
_    C          G     A7         C            D7     
the court room was adjourned no verdict was returned.
.          G      D     Em                      Am              C 
And while Lennon read a book on Marx      the quartet practiced in the park 
G            D     Em              C            D7      G  C  G 
and we sang dirges in the dark the day__    the music  died__ 
G           D7 
I started singin'      (chorus) 
.
Chorus:
.       G    C         G       D           G             C

Helter skelter in the summer swelter_ the birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Em                           D           G          D       Em 
Eight miles high and falling fast__  it landed foul on the grass
.    Am                   C                   Em                      A7      D7 
The players tried for a forward pass with the jester on the sidelines in a cast_
.   Em                 Am                      Em                 Am 
The half time air was sweet perfume while the seargeants played a marching tune
_  C      G       A7              C              D7     
we all got up to dance___  but we never got the chance.   'Cause 
.    G        D      Em                       Am              C 
the players tried to take the field, but the marching band refused to yield
.G       D        Em                       C        D7    G  C  G 
Do you recall what was revealed  _____ the day the music died.
