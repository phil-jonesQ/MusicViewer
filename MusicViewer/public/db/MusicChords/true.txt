[Intro] G, Em7, Cadd9, Bm7 (3x)    C, Fadd9
[Verse 1]
G       Bm7
So true funny how it seems 
C                   Eb                G
Always in time, but never in line for dreams. 
          Bm7               C
Head over heels when toe to toe. 
            Em          C
This is the sound of my soul, 
            G    D/F#
This is the sound 

C                        G
I bought a ticket to the world, 
C            Emadd13     G
But now I've come back again 
C        Emadd13         G
Why do I find it hard to write the next line? 
   C          Emadd13     Fadd9
Oh I want the truth to be said 


[Chorus]

G           Em7
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh 
  Cadd9    Bm7        G
I know this much is true 
            Em7
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh 
  Cadd9    Bm7     C    Fadd9
I know this much is true. 


[Verse]

G                   Bm7                C
With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue 
             Eb               G
Dissolve the nerves that just begun 
             Bm7               C
Listening to Marvin (all night long) 
            Em          C
This is the sound of my soul, 
            G     D/F#
This is the sound... 

C                       G
Always slipping from my head, 
C        Emadd13        G
Sands of time I've been told 
C         Emadd13      G
Take your seats & I'll write the next line 
C             Emadd13     Fadd9
Oh I want the truth to be known 


[Chorus]

G           Em7
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh 
Cadd9      Bm7         G
I know this much is true 
            Em7
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh 
  Cadd9    Bm7     C   Fadd9  
I know this much is true 



[Solo] Eb, Ab.... G, G6


[Bridge]

C          Emadd13       G
I bought a ticket to the world, 
C                       G    Am7, G(I), C
But now I've come back again 
         Emadd13         G
Why do I find it hard to write the next line? 
   C          Emadd13     Fadd9
Oh I want the truth to be said 

G           Em7
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh 
  Cadd9    Bm7
I know this much is true 
G           Em7
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh 
  Cadd9    Bm7        C, Emadd9, Em(I), C, Emadd9, Em(I)
I know this much is true 
     C              Fadd9
This much is true 

G, Em7, Cadd9, Bm7 (repeat)
