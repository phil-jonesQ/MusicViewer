Sent inside forever,

Never seeing no one

Nice again like you,

Mama you, mama you.

All I need is a pint a day

If I ever get out of here.

Well, the rain exploded with a mighty crash
As we fell into the sun,
        C                     Fmaj7
And the first one said to the second one there
                       Em
I hope you're having fun.
G           C    Em   C      Am
Band on the run, band on the run.
         F             C
And the jailer man and sailor Sam
     F               Fmaj7
Were searching every one
N.C.    C
For the band on the run, band on the run
Band on the run, band on the run.

Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh
Seeing no one else had come,
      C                       Fmaj7
And a bell was ringing in the village square
                         Em
For the rabbits on the run.
G           C    Em   C      Am
Band on the run, band on the run.

For the band on the run, band on the run

Band on the run, band on the run.

Well, the night was falling as the desert world
                   Em
Began to settle down.
       C                             Fmaj7
In the town they're searching for us every where
                          Em
But we never w ill be found.

Band on the run, band on the run.

Will search for evermore

Band on the run band on the run,
